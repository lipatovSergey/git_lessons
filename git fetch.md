#git #command
`git fetch` is a Git command that downloads new commits from remote repository but doesn't change your local branches or files.

- It updates remote tracking branches like [[origin main]], origin dev, etc.
- Your local branches stay the same - no merges, no file changes.
- It's like taking a snapshot of the remote repo to see what has changed.
- Useful for reviewing others work before merging or pulling.
